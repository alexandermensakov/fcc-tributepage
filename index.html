                McDonald's is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and
                Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States.</p>

            <p>They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a
                franchise,
                with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

            <p>In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase
                the
                chain from the McDonald brothers.</p>

            <p>McDonald's had its previous headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters
                to
                Chicago in June 2018</p>

                McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million
                customers
                daily
                in over 100 countries across the world.</p>
            <p>

                Although McDonald's is best known for its hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries, they
                feature
                chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts.
            </p>
            <p> In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the
                unhealthiness of
                their
                food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit.
            </p>
            <p> The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the
                franchisees,
                as
                well as sales in company-operated restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>According to two reports published in 2018, McDonald's is the world's second-largest private
                employer
                with 1.7 million employees. As of 2020, McDonald's has the ninth-highest global brand
                valuation
